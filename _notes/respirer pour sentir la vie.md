Do you take time to breathe, to feel ? If not enough, as me, you can’t develop your emotional system full spectrum.

When you discover something great on Twitter, it is quick, like a shot of emotion following a poor sensation : finger scrolling at your smartphone screen...

Don’t you think we need to spend more time in real life sensation ? Not thinking about it but feeling.

Love ❤️ is what we are all looking for everyday but if we want to be full of love we need to be full of emotion because of amazing sensational experience, and empty of thought.

Turn off your phone. Go somewhere to feel and stay in feeling until you stop thinking. Live expending love
