[[design régénératif]] - [[système complexe]] - [[bio-inspiration]] - 1.2-4 Regeneration (mooc chapter)

- sustainability is not enough
- regenerative is not another keyword for consultant

> life journey to novelty  

- we need to find a way to fit humanity inside the pattern of life to survive and live well
- need to realign with ancient regenerative knowledges

> a cell need to be regenerative in the context of it human body  
 
- we need to be in service of a larger system (like cells in our body)
- how can we heal the damage of the past?
- need to build a continuous capacity for people coming then to continue regenerate
- **shift from "outcome thinking" to "capacity thinking"**
- **shift from "product thinking" to "process thinking"**

> “Instead of doing less damage to the environment, it is necessary to learn how we can participate with the environment — using the health of ecological systems as a basis for design. […] The shift from a fragmented worldview to a whole systems mental model is the significant leap our culture must make — framing and understanding living system interrelationships in an integrated way. A place-based approach is one way to achieve this understanding. […] Our role, as designers and stakeholders is to shift our relationship to one that creates a whole system of mutually beneficial relationships.” — Bill Reed

- the pathway from sustainability to regeneration
- concept "regenerative", and how it differs from sustainability
- my answer to these questions


- _the three horizons introduce a possibility to link people who are in H1 H2 and H3 and understand their complementarities._I see an interesting

- connexion between this framework and the Design Fiction recipe so I will test it together.


- _"it is necessary to learn how we can participate with the environment"_

- we are part of the living, in service... - it is a big mindset shift for lot of people...


- _"The shift from a fragmented worldview to a whole systems mental model is the significant leap our culture must make"_

- **shift from "outcome thinking" to "capacity thinking"**
- **shift from "product thinking" to "process thinking"**

- maybe what can help is to introduce new jobs ideas

- for #business dev > no longer promise deliverables but the fact of empowering employees and the organization thanks to the work to be done
