Only because of our shared imagination, we destroyed planet Earth. Can we regenerate it if we create others stories together ?

New stories > new paradigms > new rules to play game of life, like a [[metagame]].
New game > new reality > everything is possible... did you already take Lsd or Ketamine ? What is a trip ?

New brain connexions but only in one head. Our humanity is like a neural network : **if we change our beliefs, we can create new connexions for everybody and change reality for all of us**.
Who want to converge to a new world with me ? A regenerative world, with priorities on love, care, cooperation, pleasure of playing a shared game... I am so impatient !

sure people from [@interintellect_](https://twitter.com/interintellect_) are interested in the same kind of exploration.
