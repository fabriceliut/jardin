Do you think you know what reality is ? It is physic ? Does it exist some common rules ? Red is red and blue is blue ? I think we need to be more openminded in front of Â«Â somethingÂ Â» so crazy and magical as life is.

My perceptions are not yours. My today perceptions are not the same as last year. I forgot past sensations and I try to reinterpret it with my actual being, but it create a false story of my own life, because of memory.

We change everyday. As we evolve Â«Â lifeÂ Â» become different.

to art, we can open ourself today to other realities we canâ€™t imagine by ourself.

artists to open our perceptions doors (as [@aldouxhuxley](https://twitter.com/aldouxhuxley) could say)...

Sometime I forget that the only thing I know is that I know nothing... thx Socrate, thx people who put new questions in my head. Thx art ðŸ–¼ to open my windows ðŸªŸ everyday.
