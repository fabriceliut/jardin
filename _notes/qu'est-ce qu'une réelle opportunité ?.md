-   you need to listen a lot and try to understand how you can participate • you need to make people understand how you can help and what is your value • you need to understand if this project has value for you too

If the opportunity is just ideas or concepts, it is not a project yet. Can you help it become a project? Do you want to give the energy to initiate a new project?

-   if you like people involved, if you have time or if you have money or competencies to get it... Go! • or maybe it is a too early stage for you? No problem, don't go!

You are the only person who can define if an opportunity is real or not. You can create your mental model or the framework to detect and prioritize.

Create it, don't lose your life energy. Not all opportunities are yours.
